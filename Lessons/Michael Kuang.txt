Okay, so I'm interested in learning the computer languages and how to code stuff. I really like playing MMo's, RPG's and 
some FPS games. My favourite game or so to say most frequently played game at the moment is League of Legends.
I'm not quite into sports but I'm okay at badminton and basketball. My school grades are half decent in my perpective. I'm
getting around 80's to 90's.
