1. If you are comfortable with object oriented programming in Java or objective C, go into the Projects folder and put your name in the projects that you are interested in working on.
2. If not, go to the lessons folders and sign up for one of the lessons.
3. add a text file named after you in the folder called Members and write something interesting about yourself in it
4. open github for windows and commit your changes to your local repository then sync with the online repository

note 1: All programs are writen in java except iphone apps which are in objective c.

note 2: I kind of promised the guidance counselors that the Peer Tutoring program would be done by December so it would be nice if 4-6ish people worked on it.
